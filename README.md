# FACE_RECOGNITION_SYSTEM
🧠📸 Built a Face Recognition System using Python & OpenCV!

Just wrapped up a mini project where I built a real-time face recognition system using:

Python

OpenCV for face detection

A simple custom KNN algorithm (no external ML libraries!)

It's not a huge project, but definitely one that pushed me to learn core concepts in computer vision and data handling. Projects like this help me improve my skills one step at a time — and yes, it's going straight to my resume 💪

🔍 What it does:

Captures your face using webcam

Saves and labels it

Recognizes you in real-time

This was a great hands-on experience, and I’m excited to keep building better, smarter systems as I grow in the tech space!
